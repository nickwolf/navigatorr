# Navigatorr

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives AI assistants like Claude direct access to your *arr media stack and torrent clients. Browse API documentation, make authenticated calls, and manage downloads — all through natural language.

## What It Does

Navigatorr acts as a bridge between AI coding assistants and your self-hosted media services. Instead of manually navigating web UIs or crafting API calls, you describe what you want and the AI handles the rest through Navigatorr's MCP tools.

**Supported services:**
- **Sonarr** — TV show management
- **Radarr** — Movie management
- **Lidarr** — Music management
- **Readarr** — Book management
- **Chaptarr** — Ebook and audiobook management
- **Prowlarr** — Indexer management
- **Profilarr** — Quality profile and custom format management
- **Bazarr** — Subtitle management
- **Seerr** — Request management (formerly Jellyseerr)
- **Overseerr/Jellyseerr** — Request management (legacy names, still supported)
- **Audiobookshelf** — Audiobook management
- **Transmission** — Torrent client
- **qBittorrent** — Torrent client
- **SABnzbd** — Usenet downloader

### Package Structure

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `main` | Entry point, config loading, MCP server setup |
| `config` | YAML config parsing with service defaults |
| `arrservice` | Service registry, HTTP client, auth strategies (header/query/basic) |
| `openapi` | OpenAPI spec fetching, parsing, caching, and search |
| `tools` | MCP tool registration and handlers |
| `transmission` | Transmission RPC client |
| `qbit` | qBittorrent Web API client |
| `internal` | Shared logging utilities |

### How It Works

1. **Config Loading** — Reads `~/.config/navigatorr/config.yaml` to discover services, API keys, and Transmission settings. Applies sensible defaults for known service types (API versions, auth methods, OpenAPI spec URLs).

2. **Service Registry** — Each configured service gets an authenticated HTTP client with the appropriate auth strategy (API key header, query parameter, or basic auth). The registry provides lookup by name.

3. **OpenAPI Spec Store** — On startup, fetches and parses OpenAPI specs from each service's official GitHub repo. Specs are cached to disk (`~/.cache/navigatorr/`) and indexed for fast endpoint lookup and full-text search.

4. **Tool Registration** — Four categories of tools are registered with the MCP server:
   - **API Documentation tools** — browse and search service endpoints without making calls
   - **API Call tool** — make authenticated requests with field selection, filtering, and pagination. Includes a configurable response size guard that catches oversized responses before they eat the LLM's context window, and optional destructive request protection that blocks DELETE calls unless explicitly enabled.
   - **Transmission tools** — manage torrents (list, add, start, stop, remove, verify, free space)
   - **qBittorrent tools** — manage torrents (list, add, pause, resume, delete, transfer stats)
   - **SABnzbd tools** — manage Usenet downloads (queue, history, add, pause, resume, delete, reprioritise, move)

5. **Stdio Transport** — Communicates with the MCP client over stdin/stdout using JSON-RPC, making it compatible with any MCP host (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).

## MCP Tools

### API Documentation

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_services` | List all configured services with URLs and connection status |
| `list_endpoints` | Browse API endpoints for a service, filterable by tag or HTTP method |
| `get_endpoint_details` | Full endpoint info including parameters, request body, and response schemas |
| `search_api` | Full-text search across all API specs |
| `refresh_api_specs` | Re-fetch OpenAPI specs from upstream |

### API Calls

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `call_api` | Make authenticated API calls to any service. Supports field selection (including nested array drilling like `records.title`), filtering (`field:op:value`), and result limiting. Includes a response size guard and optional DELETE protection. |

### Transmission

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `transmission_list_torrents` | List all torrents with status, progress, and speeds |
| `transmission_add_torrent` | Add a torrent by magnet link or URL |
| `transmission_manage_torrent` | Start, stop, remove, or verify torrents |
| `transmission_free_space` | Check available disk space |

### qBittorrent

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `qbit_list_torrents` | List all torrents with status, progress, and speeds |
| `qbit_add_torrent` | Add a torrent by magnet link or URL |
| `qbit_manage_torrent` | Pause, resume, delete, or delete with files |
| `qbit_transfer_info` | Global transfer speed and statistics |

### SABnzbd

SABnzbd has no OpenAPI spec and dispatches everything from a `mode` query parameter on a single endpoint, so it gets its own tools rather than going through `call_api`.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sabnzbd_list_queue` | Active downloads with status, progress, and speed |
| `sabnzbd_history` | Finished and failed downloads, filterable by category, search term, or failures only |
| `sabnzbd_add_nzb` | Queue an NZB by URL, with optional name, category, and priority |
| `sabnzbd_manage_item` | Pause, resume, delete, reprioritise, or move a job by `nzo_id`. Deletes take `target` to pick the queue (default) or the history |
| `sabnzbd_status` | Version, speed, disk space, paused state, and warning count |

Deleting is covered by `allow_destructive`. SABnzbd deletes are GET requests carrying `name=delete`, so the `call_api` DELETE guard does not apply to them and these tools check the setting themselves.

A history delete is permanent. SABnzbd archives the entry rather than removing it unless `archive=0` is sent, so `sabnzbd_manage_item` sends it and the entry is gone for good. Because of that, `target=history` refuses SABnzbd's `all`, `failed` and `completed` selectors, which would take every failed and completed entry, archived ones included, in one call. The queue still accepts `all`, since a cancelled queue job can be grabbed again.

### Request Queue

A holding area for media requests that arrive while no agent is running. Something outside navigatorr — a phone shortcut, a webhook, the iMessage bridge in `scripts/` — posts free-form text over HTTP, and the next agent session drains it.

The queue stores the text verbatim rather than parsing it. Working out which show "boston legal" means, which quality profile fits, and whether it duplicates something already in the library is judgment work for the agent, not for a parser.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `queue_list` | List requests, defaulting to pending. Reports counts for the other statuses so a backlog parked in `claimed` is visible. |
| `queue_claim` | Claim a pending request before working it, so two agents do not double-add it |
| `queue_resolve` | Close a request as `done` or `failed` with a note describing what happened |
| `queue_release` | Return a claimed request to pending when an agent gives up without resolving |

Requests move `pending → claimed → done`/`failed`, and the transitions are enforced: an item cannot be claimed twice, resolved twice, or released unless it is currently claimed. Releasing a finished request would otherwise put completed work back in the queue for an agent to action a second time.

```
POST /request   {"text": "boston legal", "source": "imessage"}   -> 201
GET  /queue?status=pending                                       -> 200
GET  /healthz                                                    -> 200 (no auth)
```

**The HTTP endpoint is optional and requires a token.** The MCP tools work with `listen` unset, which keeps the queue agent-only with nothing listening. When `listen` is set, `token` is required and navigatorr refuses to start without one — text in this queue is later read and acted on by an agent holding write credentials to every configured service, so an unauthenticated endpoint is a way to drive that agent, not just a way to add spam. Prefer binding loopback and reaching it through a tunnel or a reverse proxy that terminates TLS; the bearer token crosses the network in clear text.

The queue file is held under an advisory lock for the life of the process. MCP servers are spawned per client, so without one, navigatorr running under two clients at once would give two processes independent copies of the same file and each would overwrite the other's requests.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- Running *arr services with API keys
- (Optional) Transmission and/or qBittorrent torrent client
- (Optional) SABnzbd for Usenet

### Option 1: Build from Source

```bash
go build -o navigatorr .
```

### Option 2: Docker

```bash
docker build -t navigatorr .
```

### Configure

Copy the example config and fill in your values:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/navigatorr
cp config.yaml.example ~/.config/navigatorr/config.yaml
```

Edit `~/.config/navigatorr/config.yaml` with your service URLs and API keys. You can find API keys in each service's Settings > General page.

**Optional global settings:**

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `max_response_size_kb` | `50` | Response size guard threshold in KB. API responses exceeding this are rejected with a hint to use field selection/filtering instead of consuming the LLM's context window. |
| `allow_destructive` | `false` | When false, blocks all DELETE requests through `call_api`, and refuses the destructive actions in the torrent client tools (`qbit_manage_torrent` delete/delete_files, `transmission_manage_torrent` remove/remove_data). Set to `true` to enable deletions. |

### Connect to Claude Code

**Using the binary directly:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "navigatorr": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/path/to/navigatorr",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

**Using Docker:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "navigatorr": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "--rm", "-i",
        "-v", "~/.config/navigatorr/config.yaml:/root/.config/navigatorr/config.yaml:ro",
        "--network", "host",
        "navigatorr"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** `--network host` is used so the container can reach your *arr services on the local network. If your services are on a remote host, you can use the default bridge network instead. The `-i` flag is required for stdio transport. Do not use `-t` as it interferes with the JSON-RPC communication.

**Custom config path:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "navigatorr": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/path/to/navigatorr",
      "args": ["-config", "/path/to/config.yaml"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

Once connected, you can ask Claude things like:

- "What TV shows do I have in Sonarr?"
- "Search for a new series and add it"
- "Show me all movies missing from Radarr"
- "What torrents are currently downloading?"
- "Add this magnet link to qBittorrent"
- "How much free disk space do I have?"
- "Delete a series and re-add it with a different quality profile"
- "Unmonitor all movies in a franchise except the recent ones"

The AI uses Navigatorr's tools behind the scenes to browse API docs, discover the right endpoints, and make authenticated calls on your behalf.

### Demo Walkthrough

**1. Discover your services**
```
> "What services do I have?"
→ Tool: list_services
```
```
sonarr    → http://your-server:8989 (235 endpoints)
radarr    → http://your-server:7878 (238 endpoints)
lidarr    → http://your-server:8686 (236 endpoints)
prowlarr  → http://your-server:9696 (129 endpoints)
seerr     → http://your-server:5055 (212 endpoints)
...
```

**2. Search API endpoints without reading docs**
```
> "How do I manage quality profiles in Sonarr?"
→ Tool: search_api → query: "quality", service: "sonarr"
```
Returns 11 matching endpoints — GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for quality profiles and definitions. No digging through API docs.

**3. Browse endpoints by category**
```
> "What can I do with series?"
→ Tool: list_endpoints → service: "sonarr", tag: "Series"
```
```
GET    /api/v3/series       — List all series
POST   /api/v3/series       — Add a series
GET    /api/v3/series/{id}  — Get series details
PUT    /api/v3/series/{id}  — Update a series
DELETE /api/v3/series/{id}  — Delete a series
```

**4. Make authenticated API calls**
```
> "Show me all my TV shows"
→ Tool: call_api → service: "sonarr", path: "/series"
```
Returns full JSON with all series, episodes, and quality info. Handles auth headers, API versioning, and URL construction automatically. Supports field selection, filtering, and result limiting.

**5. Manage torrents**
```
> "What's downloading right now?"
→ Tool: transmission_list_torrents
```
```
Some.Show.S01E01.720p → downloading (45.2%)
Another.Show.S03.Pack → seeding (100%)
```

**6. Chain it all together**

The real power is that Claude chains tools automatically. Say:

> "Delete a series and re-add it with a different quality profile"

Claude will:
1. `call_api` GET /series → find the series ID
2. `call_api` DELETE /series/{id} with deleteFiles=true
3. `search_api` → discover the quality profile endpoints
4. `call_api` GET /qualityprofile → list available profiles
5. `call_api` POST /series → re-add with the new profile
6. `call_api` POST /command → trigger a search

All from one sentence.
